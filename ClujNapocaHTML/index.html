<p>The Dacian city of Napuca was first mentioned in documents two thousand 
years ago by the Greek geographer, Claudius Ptolomaeus (85-165). This has 
not yet been proved by archaeologists, but it is a known fact, that this 
was succeeded by a Roman settlement, Napoca. The settlement was then raised 
to the rank of city during the reign of Emperor Hadrian (117-138), with its 
full name "Municipium Aelium Hadrianum Napoca", and received the rank of a 
colony around the year 180, under the name of "Colonia Aurelia Napoca."</p>

<a name="Dark Ages">Dark Ages</a>

<p>After the Dark Ages of migration, when the Gepids built an ephemeral 
royal residence around Cluj, in 1173, the city reappears in documents under 
the name of Clus (Latin for "dark spot between the hills"). Other names of 
the city are Kolozsvár (in Hungarian) and Klausenburg (in German) named by 
the Saxon settlers from Baden-Württemberg, who have settled down in the city 
of Cluj after the attack of the Tatars which devastated the city in the 
thirteenth century.</p>

<a name="Klausenburg">Klausenburg</a>

<p>Klausenburg was one of the seven Transylvanian Saxon settlements, which 
have been privileged to be surrounded by walls, becoming a medieval burg that 
gave the German name to the province - Siebenburgen.
The first name of the city was Clus, written sometimes as Klus. In 1974, with 
the full expansion of the national communism, its name was changed to 
Cluj-Napoca, to highlight the city's Latin roots.</p>

<a name="King Carol Robert">King Carol Robert</a>

<p>In 1316, the privileges offered by King Carol Robert of Anjou offered it the 
status of a ‘(free) royal city’. Among the most important privileges are: the 
right to have its own administration, the right to trial, the right to have 
commercial exchanges, the right to build churches and graveyards and so on. 
In 1405, King Sigismund of Luxembourg offered new privileges to the city, among 
which the right to expand the fortification.</p>

<a name="Matthias Corvinus">Matthias Corvinus</a>

<p>The city also enjoyed the special protection of another great king who was born 
in Cluj: Matthias Corvinus (1458-1490). The construction and restoration of one the 
most representative monuments in the city are all linked to his name: the finalization 
of the construction of the St. Michael’s church (around the year 1480) and the 
building of the Tailors' Tower in 1475. But maybe the most important building in Cluj, 
directly linked to the name of Matthias Corvinus was the church located on the Lupilor 
street (today M. Kogălniceanu street), whose construction, which began in 1486, 
was funded by a consistent royal donation.</p>

<a name="The Treasure City">Treasure-City</a>

<p>Reinforced by the granted privileges and enjoying the protection of great kings, 
the city has flourished in the second half of the sixteenth century, when it came 
to be known as "the treasure city".
At the beginning of the seventeenth century, Cluj is enshrined by a popular vintage 
stamp as „Transilvaniae civitas primaria”. But the end of the century will bring 
sorrow to the city, with wars and plagues making the author exclaim that the 
"treasure-city" slowly became "the beggar city”.</p>

<p>In 1918, when Transylvania is united with Romania, Cluj is already a modern, 
thriving city, fully connected to the "spirit of that age." During the interwar period 
the city continued to develop as one of the most important cities in Great Romania. 
During the Second World War, the city was part of the territory ceded to Hungary.</p>
